# Ogrody i porządek

Presentation of a fully responsive RWD website, built based on the mobile first rule, dedicated to gardening and cleaning services. SPA (Single Page Application) with home and contact pages, with an emphasis on speed, proper handling of static resources, and implementation on GitHub Pages.

## Project goals:
- preparation of a lightweight, attractive, responsive offer page with the addition of smooth framer-motion animations,
- configuration of a reliable build and hosting on GitHub Pages,
- correct management of resource paths (images) when hosting in a subdirectory,
- Demonstration of skills in React, React Router, Redux toolkit, TypeScript, and custom hook creation.

## Technology stack:
- React 19 + TypeScript 5,
- Vite 7 (fast dev server and bundling),
- React Router (SPA with basename),
- Redux Toolkit (global status – prepared for further development),
- Sass/SCSS (layout + responsiveness, custom mixins, module files, variables),
- Framer Motion (micro-interaction animations),
- * Mechanics of sending data from a form (Node, Express—a little bit of backend—but this is not my area of expertise yet, so I used external help here) *

 ## Key features:
 - Responsive layout and typography (breakpoint mixins),
 - DOPISAĆ JUTRO
